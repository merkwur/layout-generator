Dear Tester, 

First of all, thank you for your participation in this review. 

Before you start I would love to point out some caveats. The algorithm operates on two circles. The first one stands on the page. The other one lives on the circumference of the first circle. The left panel is where the settings are. Also, the left mouse button is panning and the mouse wheel is zooming the layout.

The first setting is the position of the first circle. You can adjust the circle center where it stands on the page. 

The second setting is the position of the second circle which can be repositioned by setting the angle. It runs counterclockwise and spans 360.

The third setting is for adjusting the circles' radius respectively. 

The fourth ones are changing the page dimensions respectively. 

Last but not least, selecting boxes are for setting the grid line angle.

Thank you so much. 

PS: The algorithm is working well, I presume. But it will be refined by your
suggestions. And, please ignore the line widths, colors, UI/UX issues, etc...
To get most of this, open in Chrome. And play in full screen.
